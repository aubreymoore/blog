### Recording Synonyms

* According to [GBIF GNA Profile Reference Guide for Darwin Core Archive, Core Terms and Extensions](http://www.gbif.org/system/files_force/gbif_resource/resource-80642/gbif_gna_profile_reference_guide.pdf?download=1): "Synonyms occupy separate lines and therefore also have unique taxonIDs."

* In [Publishing Species Checklists, Step-by-Step Guide](http://www.gbif.org/system/files_force/gbif_resource/resource-80647/checklist_how-tw.v2.pdf), there is a good example of how to handle synonyms on page 18.  This is a very good, detailed reference.

* Several references indicate that misspellings should be noted in **dwc:taxonRemarks**. Example: "this name is a misspelling in common use"
