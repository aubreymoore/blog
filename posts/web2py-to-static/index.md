I am building a web site using the web2py framework.  The site uses data stored
in MySQL database to build an index page of crops. For each crop, there is a
link to a page which is built to display all pests attacking the crop.

I would like to host
a copy of this as a static site in GitHub pages.  Creating the static site was
surprisingly easy:

1. Use wget to save local a local copy of every page generated by the site:
~~~
wget --recursive --no-clobber --page-requisites \
 --adjust-extension --convert-links \
 --restrict-file-names=windows \
 --no-parent \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/pestlist/default/crop_index
~~~   
2. On the **crop_index.html** page, change links to the **pest_index.html** pages. Easily done using **relace all** in **atom** or some other
editor.
