Just watched a very interesting [documentary on algorithms on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80095881?trackId=13752289&tctx=0%2C0%2C4f12424f4359b0f8b32bdd09fc59ea76a07bbb6f%3A84529c0d4cedd514187a2a7bc19a7313ee6513b3). 

Of particular interest to me was a segment on how buble bees solve the "travelling salesman problem". Harmonic radar waws used in this research.
